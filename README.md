Project created for the Digital Audio and Speech processing course in the Signals and Systems track @ TuDelft. 
The script performs single-microphone denoising of speech segments corrupted with different kinds of noise and evaluates the performance of the applied algorithm using MSE and [STOI](https://doi-org.tudelft.idm.oclc.org/10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5495701).
